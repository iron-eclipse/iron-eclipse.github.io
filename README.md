That's great! It is always good to test files when you create a new repository. This helps to verify that every aspect of the repository is functioning correctly. Create a new file, upload some code or text, preview the changes, commit the new file to your repository, and then try to retrieve or clone it to a different location. All these steps would make sure that your repository is working as expected. 

If you are using a version control system like Git with a place like Github, don't forget to use a README.md file as well. It can help other developers understand what your repo is about, how to install or use your code, and any other important details. 

Happy coding!
